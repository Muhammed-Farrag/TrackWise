A different way to go about this would be abandoning exact inference in favor of approximate inference. Doing this, we lose some precision in the generated probabilities, but often this imprecision is negligible. Instead, we gain a scalable method of calculating probabilities."

    "    To generate a distribution using sampling with a die, we can roll the die multiple times and record what value we got each time. Suppose we rolled the die 600 times. We count how many times we got 1, which is supposed to be roughly 100, and then repeat for the rest of the values, 2-6. Then, we divide each count by the total number of rolls. This will generate an approximate distribution of the values of rolling a die: on one hand, it is unlikely that we get the result that each value has a probability of 1/6 of    occurring (which is the exact probability), but we will get a value that’s close to it."

    "Here is an example : if we start with sampling the Rain variable, the value none will be generated with probability of 0.7, the value light will be generated with probability of 0.2, and the value heavy will be generated with probability of 0.1. Suppose that the sampled value we get is none. When we get to the Maintenance variable, we sample it, too, but only from the probability distribution where Rain is equal to none, because this is an already sampled result. We will continue to do so through all the nodes. Now we have one sample, and repeating this process multiple times generates a distribution. Now, if we want to answer a question, such as what is P(Train = on time), we can count the number of samples where the variable Train has the value on time, and divide the result by the total number of samples. This way, we have just generated an approximate probability for P(Train = on time)."

We sample a value of Rain given its probability distribution, then Maintenance, but when we get to Train - we always give it the observed value, in our case, on time. Then we proceed and sample Appointment based on its probability distribution given Train = on time. Now that this sample exists, we weight it by the conditional probability of the observed variable given its sampled parents. That is, if we sampled Rain and got light, and then we sampled Maintenance and got yes, then we will weight this sample by P(Train = on time | light, yes)."
